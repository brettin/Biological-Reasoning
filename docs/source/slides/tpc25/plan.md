# **Lightning Talk Plan (8-10 minutes)**

**Title:** _Biological Reasoning System (BioR5): A Three-Layer AI Architecture_

---

## **1. Introduction (1 min)**

- **Hook:** "Biologists use at least 11 distinct reasoning modes—from evolutionary to mechanistic—but AI struggles to integrate them. We’re fixing this."
- **Name:** "BioR5 is our framework for Biological Reasoning—let me show you how it works."

## **2. The Three-Layer Architecture (5 mins)**

- **Layer A (LLM Core):**
  - General biological knowledge + language (textbooks, concepts).
  - Example: Explains teleonomic reasoning ("Why does this trait exist?").
- **Layer B (Specialist Models):**
  - Handles non-text data (sequences, images, structures).
  - Example: txgemma reasons about xxx
- **Layer C (External Tools):**
  - Web Search, APIs, databases for precision.
  - Example: accessing external database for support
- **The Coordinator & Task Graph:**
  - Central "conductor" managing workflow
  - Graph-based scheduler for optimal task sequencing
- **Visual:** Architecture diagram (highlight data flow between layers).

## **3. Why It Matters (2 mins)**

- **Modularity:** Swap LLMs or add new tools without redesign.
- **Future Vision:** "Imagine an AI that reasons like a biologist—this is step one."
- **Call to Action:** "We’re building this—join us!"

## **4. Q&A (1-2 mins)**

**Slide Deck Tips:**

- **Slide 1:** Title + BioR5 definition ("Biological Reasoning System").
- **Slide 2:** Diagram of the three layers.
- **Slides 3-5:** One slide per layer (icon + example).
- **Final Slide:** "Get involved: [contact info]."

**Delivery:**

- Pause after naming BioR5 to let it sink in.
- Use the acronym sparingly (2-3 times max).
- End with a clear takeaway: "This architecture bridges AI and biology’s reasoning modes."
